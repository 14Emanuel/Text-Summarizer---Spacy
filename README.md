# ARTICLE SUMMARIZER

This project apparently will be solving a personal problem. I normally stay updated about global news through reading article and blogs from new outlets e.g bbc news, dw news, new york times. The articles are verbose and make reading as many articles as possible slower. I decided to use my Natural Language Processing skills to build an application that will summarize any article or blog in only 4 sentences. This has been an Instant success to my morning schedule since now I can read averagely 20 articles in 30 minutes instead of 10. This application will help me increase my global awareness through articles even more.
